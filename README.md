Artifical Neural Network from Scratch
12/4/18

This repository contains both the source files and data used to implement/train 
and test an artificial neural network.

	Neuron.py  contains a class definition for the neurons of the network
	IrisANN.py contains a class definition for the neural network 
		   constructed to solve the problem
	iris.py    contains the source that imports data, trains, and tests
                   the model.

The data is already split into training, validation, and testing
